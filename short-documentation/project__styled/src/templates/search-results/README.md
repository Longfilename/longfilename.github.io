# Search Results

The search results template is different from other templates due to the lack of a `page-footer`.

The footer is not present because most users will be searching on terms that return so many results that the user will not scroll through all of them. So teasing them with a footer element that is always just out of reach would lead to a poor user experience. Because when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page, more results are loaded - pushing the footer further out of reach.
