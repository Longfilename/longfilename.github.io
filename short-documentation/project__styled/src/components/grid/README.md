# Custom Bootstrap Grid

The grid used in the ACME site is a custom version of the [Bootstrap grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/grid/).

The grid sizes are set in the global `_variables.scss` file.

The grid and breakpoint widths are set so that the grid is always on a 24px horizontal and 24px vertical grid. The `.debug-grid` class is used to make sure all content is aligned to the horizontal and vertical grid.
